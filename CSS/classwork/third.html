        <p class="p">oil painting, painting in oil colours, a medium consisting of pigments suspended in drying oils. 
            The outstanding facility with which fusion of tones or colour is achieved makes it unique among 
            fluid painting mediums; at the same time, satisfactory linear treatment and crisp effects are easily obtained.
             Opaque, transparent, and translucent painting all lie within its range, and it is unsurpassed for textural variation.

        <p class="p">Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer 
            emulsion and plasticizers, silicone oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps. Most
             acrylic paints are water-based, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is
              diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can 
              resemble a watercolor, a gouache, or an oil painting, or it may have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.</p>

        <p class="p">Digital painting is the creation of imagery on a computer, using pixels
             (picture elements) which are assigned a color. The process uses raster 
             graphics rather than vector graphics, and can render graduated or blended
              colors in imagery which mimics traditional drawing and painting media</p>
