Step 3: Install Dependencies For a backend project, you’ll typically need a web framework like Express.

Install Express: npm install express This command installs Express and adds it to the dependencies section of the package.json file.

Step 4: Create the Entry Point (index.js) Create a new file index.js inside the project directory. This will be the entry point of your backend server.

5.In the package.json file, add a start script if you want to add ES modules, add "type": "module" to your package.json

6.run the server using the start script defined in package.json: npm start
